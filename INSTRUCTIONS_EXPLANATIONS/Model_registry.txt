The model registry is just where all those model versions live, plus their metadata.

Each vX.Y folder is one immutable model version. It contains:
the serialized model artifact (e.g. model.joblib), meta.yaml with provenance info (version, created_at, data_snapshot_id, git_sha, image_digest, maybe metrics), optionally a model_card.md.

HOW IT WORKS WITH API:

The trainer writes new subfolders into model_registry/ (v1.0, v1.1, …).
The API service (service/app.py) knows the path of the registry (via MODEL_REGISTRY_ROOT).
On startup it loads a default version (e.g. INITIAL_MODEL_VERSION).
The /switch endpoint can change the active version by pointing to a different vX.Y folder in the registry.

LIFECYCLE:

Trainer runs → creates model_registry/v1.1/ with model.joblib + meta.yaml.
hit /switch?model=v1.1 on the API.
The service starts using the new model for recommendations.
